Removing or Deleteing Documents 

db.<collectionName>.remove(<expr>)
                           (where expression)

this is a multi document operation. Depending on the where expression

== EXAMPLE ==

1. db.test.remove ( { _id : 100 } ) 

good practice run db.find on your delete expression to find out what documents you are deleteing or

2. db.test.remove ( { } )   <-- delete all documents 

3. db.users.remove({"addr.city" : "Lyon" , "registered" : false})
 -- removes all users where object address.city = lyon AND registered = false
