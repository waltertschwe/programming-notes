First, to get this thing going, we'll need to resolve some dependencies. To do that, run this command from the terminal:

$ sudo apt-get install php-pear php5-dev

Next, you should easily be able to install the driver with the following command:

$ sudo pecl install mongo

What makes Ubuntu 12.04 a little different from other systems in how PHP extensions get loading when Apache/PHP starts. To make sure this extension gets loaded, we'll need to add a .ini file to "/etc/php5/conf.d". To do that, run the following command:

$ sudo touch /etc/php5/conf.d/mongo.ini

After creating the file, add this line of content:

extension=mongo.so

After you've saved your new .ini file, restart Apache and verify that the extension is loading with phpinfo().
