Things to decide.

1. what are the collections
2. How many collections
3. embedding vs linking  

Aspects to keep in mind

1. structure for the queries 
2. sharding (partition data)
3. atomicity requirements.  
(ACID) Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability 
mongodb supports atomic operations (ACID) on single documents.  if two documents would not be atomic operation 

Linking - one document to another. similar to foregin keys in the relational world.
Embed - putting different data structures in the same collection
