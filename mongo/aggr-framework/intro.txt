Very similar to:
SQL: 
   "Group By"

Transforms/filters and reducers

$match - filters down documents ( much like where clause)
$project - pulls out certain fields from the document
$group   - how we aggregate
$sort    - sorting
$limit   - limit the amount of output after sorting
$unwind  - unwinds an array that is embedded in a document

sample: 
db.collectionName.aggregate (
[
  { $match : _____ },
  { $project : _____ },
  { $group : ________)
]
);

## FIND AND MODIFY COMMAND  
-  atomic operation
