Replication Factor
rf = 3 
n = 3
we have 3 copies of the data 

100mm docs
20 shards 
5mm docs/per shard average 

If you have a replication of 3 then you are really storing
300 Million documents 

Replication on mongodb is asynchronous 
meaning you can get acknowledgment before data has been replicated to all machines 

- always a single primary (not master-master)
- is "statement-based"
